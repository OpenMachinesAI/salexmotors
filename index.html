      <h1>What's Trinity?</h1>

    <p>It's a sleek, modern bicycle that's perfect for adults but also great for kids and teens.<p>
 
 <p>It's got this 5 inch touch screen that shows you everything you need to know while riding, like your speed, distance, and even GPS directions.<p>

<p>What makes Trinity super special is its smart features. It has a camera facing the road to keep an eye on things and can respond to your voice commands. Want to play some music? Just ask Trinity. Need to know how fast you're going? Trinity's got you covered. If something goes wrong and you have a crash, Trinity can even call for help if you don't respond.<p>

<p>This bike looks futuristic and stylish, with the touch screen and camera blending right into the frame.<p> 
      
<p>It's not just about looks, though â€“ it's designed to make your ride safer and more fun. Trinity is like having a smart assistant right there with you on every ride, making biking cooler and easier than ever.<p>
